<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 1</span> Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>
<p>The thesis of this book is that data
combined with practical methods can answer questions and guide decisions
under uncertainty.</p>
<p>As an example, I present a case study
motivated by a question I heard when my wife and I were expecting our
first child: do first babies tend to arrive late?</p>
<p>If you Google this question, you will
find plenty of discussion. Some people claim it’s true, others say it’s
a myth, and some people say it’s the other way around: first babies come
early.</p>
<p>In many of these discussions, people
provide data to support their claims. I found many examples like
these:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My two friends that have given birth
recently to their first babies, BOTH went almost 2 weeks overdue
before going into labour or being induced.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“My first one came 2 weeks late and now
I think the second one is going to come out two weeks early!!”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I don’t think that can be true because
my sister was my mother’s first and she was early, as with many of my
cousins.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reports like these are called anecdotal evidence because they are
based on data that is unpublished and usually personal. In casual
conversation, there is nothing wrong with anecdotes, so I don’t mean to
pick on the people I quoted.</p>
<p>But we might want evidence that is more
persuasive and an answer that is more reliable. By those standards,
anecdotal evidence usually fails, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small number of observations: If
pregnancy length is longer for first babies, the difference is
probably small compared to natural variation. In that case, we might
have to compare a large number of pregnancies to be sure that a
difference exists.</li>
<li>Selection bias: People who join a
discussion of this question might be interested because their first
babies were late. In that case the process of selecting data would
bias the results.<br />
</li>
<li>Confirmation bias: People who believe
the claim might be more likely to contribute examples that confirm
it. People who doubt the claim are more likely to cite
counterexamples.<br />
</li>
<li>Inaccuracy: Anecdotes are often
personal stories, and often misremembered, misrepresented, repeated
inaccurately, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>So how can we do better?</p>
<div id="a-statistical-approach" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> A Statistical Approach</h2>
<p>To address the limitations of anecdotes,
we will use the tools of statistics, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data collection: We will use data
from a large national survey that was designed explicitly with the
goal of generating statistically valid inferences about the U.S.
population.</li>
<li>Descriptive statistics: We will
generate statistics that summarize the data concisely, and evaluate
different ways to visualize data.</li>
<li>Exploratory data analysis: We will
look for patterns, differences, and other features that address the
questions we are interested in. At the same time we will check for
inconsistencies and identify limitations.</li>
<li><p>Estimation: We will use data from a
sample to estimate characteristics of the general population.</p></li>
<li><p>Hypothesis testing: Where we see
apparent effects, like a difference between two groups, we will
evaluate whether the effect might have happened by chance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By performing these steps with care to
avoid pitfalls, we can reach conclusions that are more justifiable and
more likely to be correct.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-national-survey-of-family-growth" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> The National Survey of Family Growth</h2>
<p>Since 1973 the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) have conducted the National Survey of
Family Growth (NSFG), which is intended to gather “information on family
life, marriage and divorce, pregnancy, infertility, use of
contraception, and men’s and women’s health. The survey results are used
… to plan health services and health education programs, and to do
statistical studies of families, fertility, and health.” See
<a href="http://cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg.htm">http://cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg.htm</a>.</p>
<p>We will use data collected by this survey
to investigate whether first babies tend to come late, and other
questions. In order to use this data effectively, we have to understand
the design of the study.</p>
<p>The NSFG is a cross-sectional study, which means that
it captures a snapshot of a group at a point in time. The most common
alternative is a longitudinal
study, which observes a group repeatedly over a period of time.</p>
<p>The NSFG has been conducted seven times;
each deployment is called a cycle.
We will use data from Cycle 6, which was conducted from January 2002 to
March 2003.</p>
<p>The goal of the survey is to draw
conclusions about a population;
the target population of the NSFG is people in the United States aged
15-44. Ideally surveys would collect data from every member of the
population, but that’s seldom possible. Instead we collect data from a
subset of the population called a sample. The people who participate in a
survey are called respondents.</p>
<p>In general, cross-sectional studies are
meant to be representative, which
means that every member of the target population has an equal chance of
participating. That ideal is hard to achieve in practice, but people who
conduct surveys come as close as they can.</p>
<p>The NSFG is not representative; instead
it is deliberately oversampled.
The designers of the study recruited three groups—Hispanics,
African-Americans and teenagers—at rates higher than their
representation in the U.S. population, in order to make sure that the
number of respondents in each of these groups is large enough to draw
valid statistical inferences.</p>
<p>Of course, the drawback of oversampling
is that it is not as easy to draw conclusions about the general
population based on statistics from the survey. We will come back to
this point later.</p>
<p>When working with this kind of data, it
is important to be familiar with the codebook, which documents the design of
the study, the survey questions, and the encoding of the responses. The
codebook and user’s guide for the NSFG data are available from
<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/nsfg_cycle6.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/nsfg_cycle6.htm</a></p>
</div>
<div id="importing-the-data" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Importing the Data</h2>
<p>The code and data used in this book are
available from <a href="https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkStats2">https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkStats2</a>. For information about downloading and working
with this code, see Section <a href="index.html#using-the-code">0.2</a>.</p>
<p>Once you download the code, you should
have a file called <code>ThinkStats2/code/nsfg.py</code>. If you
run it, it should read a data file, run some tests, and print a message
like, “All tests passed.”</p>
<p>Let’s see what it does. Pregnancy data
from Cycle 6 of the NSFG is in a file called <code>2002FemPreg.dat.gz</code>; it is a
gzip-compressed data file in plain text (ASCII), with fixed width
columns. Each line in the file is a record that contains data about one
pregnancy.</p>
<p>The format of the file is documented in
<code>2002FemPreg.dct</code>, which is a
Stata dictionary file. Stata is a statistical software system; a
“dictionary” in this context is a list of variable names, types, and
indices that identify where in each line to find each variable.</p>
<p>For example, here are a few lines from
2002FemPreg.dct:</p>
<pre><code>infile dictionary {
  _column(1)  str12  caseid    %12s  &quot;RESPONDENT ID NUMBER&quot;
  _column(13) byte   pregordr   %2f  &quot;PREGNANCY ORDER (NUMBER)&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>This dictionary describes two variables:
caseid is a 12-character
string that represents the respondent ID; pregorder is a one-byte integer
that indicates which pregnancy this record describes for this
respondent.</p>
<p>The code you downloaded includes <code>thinkstats2.py</code>, which is a Python
module that contains many classes and functions used in this book,
including functions that read the Stata dictionary and the NSFG data
file. Here’s how they are used in nsfg.py:</p>
<pre><code>def ReadFemPreg(dct_file=&#39;2002FemPreg.dct&#39;,
                dat_file=&#39;2002FemPreg.dat.gz&#39;):
    dct = thinkstats2.ReadStataDct(dct_file)
    df = dct.ReadFixedWidth(dat_file, compression=&#39;gzip&#39;)
    CleanFemPreg(df)
    return df</code></pre>
<p><code>ReadStataDct</code> takes the name of the
dictionary file and returns dct, a <code>FixedWidthVariables</code> object that
contains the information from the dictionary file. dct provides <code>ReadFixedWidth</code>, which reads the
data file.</p>
</div>
<div id="dataframes" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> DataFrames</h2>
<p>The result of <code>ReadFixedWidth</code> is a DataFrame,
which is the fundamental data structure provided by pandas, which is a
Python data and statistics package we’ll use throughout this book. A
DataFrame contains a row for each record, in this case one row per
pregnancy, and a column for each variable.</p>
<p>In addition to the data, a DataFrame also
contains the variable names and their types, and it provides methods for
accessing and modifying the data.</p>
<p>If you print df you get a truncated view of the
rows and columns, and the shape of the DataFrame, which is 13593
rows/records and 244 columns/variables.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import nsfg
&gt;&gt;&gt; df = nsfg.ReadFemPreg()
&gt;&gt;&gt; df
...
[13593 rows x 244 columns]</code></pre>
<p>The DataFrame is too big to display, so
the output is truncated. The last line reports the number of rows and
columns.</p>
<p>The attribute columns returns a sequence of
column names as Unicode strings:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; df.columns
Index([u&#39;caseid&#39;, u&#39;pregordr&#39;, u&#39;howpreg_n&#39;, u&#39;howpreg_p&#39;, ... ])</code></pre>
<p>The result is an Index, which is another
pandas data structure. We’ll learn more about Index later, but for now
we’ll treat it like a list:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; df.columns[1]
&#39;pregordr&#39;</code></pre>
<p>To access a column from a DataFrame, you
can use the column name as a key:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; pregordr = df[&#39;pregordr&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(pregordr)
&lt;class &#39;pandas.core.series.Series&#39;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The result is a Series, yet another
pandas data structure. A Series is like a Python list with some
additional features. When you print a Series, you get the indices and
the corresponding values:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; pregordr
0     1
1     2
2     1
3     2
...
13590    3
13591    4
13592    5
Name: pregordr, Length: 13593, dtype: int64</code></pre>
<p>In this example the indices are integers
from 0 to 13592, but in general they can be any sortable type. The
elements are also integers, but they can be any type.</p>
<p>The last line includes the variable name,
Series length, and data type; int64 is one of the types provided
by NumPy. If you run this example on a 32-bit machine you might see
int32.</p>
<p>You can access the elements of a Series
using integer indices and slices:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; pregordr[0]
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; pregordr[2:5]
2    1
3    2
4    3
Name: pregordr, dtype: int64</code></pre>
<p>The result of the index operator is an
int64; the result of the
slice is another Series.</p>
<p>You can also access the columns of a
DataFrame using dot notation:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; pregordr = df.pregordr</code></pre>
<p>This notation only works if the column
name is a valid Python identifier, so it has to begin with a letter,
can’t contain spaces, etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="variables" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Variables</h2>
<p>We have already seen two variables in the
NSFG dataset, <code>caseid</code> and
<code>pregordr</code>, and we have seen
that there are 244 variables in total. For the explorations in this
book, I use the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>caseid</code> is the integer ID of the respondent.</li>
<li><code>prglngth</code> is the integer duration of the pregnancy in weeks.</li>
<li><code>outcome</code> is an integer code for the outcome of the pregnancy. The code 1 indicates a live birth.</li>
<li><code>pregordr</code> is a pregnancy serial number; for example, the code for a respondent’s first pregnancy is
1, for the second pregnancy is 2, and so on.</li>
<li><code>birthord</code> is a serial number for
live births; the code for a respondent’s first child is 1, and so
on. For outcomes other than live birth, this field is blank.</li>
<li><code>birthwgt_lb</code> and <code>birthwgt_oz</code>
contain the pounds and ounces parts of the birth weight of the baby.</li>
<li><code>agepreg</code> is the mother’s age at the end of the pregnancy.</li>
<li><code>finalwgt</code> is the statistical
weight associated with the respondent. It is a floating-point value
that indicates the number of people in the U.S. population this
respondent represents.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you read the codebook carefully, you
will see that many of the variables are recodes, which means that they are not
part of the raw data collected by
the survey; they are calculated using the raw data.</p>
<p>For example, <code>prglngth</code> for live births is equal
to the raw variable wksgest
(weeks of gestation) if it is available; otherwise it is estimated using
<code>mosgest * 4.33</code> (months of
gestation times the average number of weeks in a month).</p>
<p>Recodes are often based on logic that
checks the consistency and accuracy of the data. In general it is a good
idea to use recodes when they are available, unless there is a
compelling reason to process the raw data yourself.</p>
</div>
<div id="transformation" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> Transformation</h2>
<p>When you import data like this, you often
have to check for errors, deal with special values, convert data into
different formats, and perform calculations. These operations are called
data cleaning.</p>
<p><code>nsfg.py</code> includes <code>CleanFemPreg</code>, a function that
cleans the variables I am planning to use.</p>
<pre><code>def CleanFemPreg(df):
    df.agepreg /= 100.0

    na_vals = [97, 98, 99]
    df.birthwgt_lb.replace(na_vals, np.nan, inplace=True)
    df.birthwgt_oz.replace(na_vals, np.nan, inplace=True)

    df[&#39;totalwgt_lb&#39;] = df.birthwgt_lb + df.birthwgt_oz / 16.0    </code></pre>
<p><code>agepreg</code> contains the mother’s age
at the end of the pregnancy. In the data file, <code>agepreg</code> is encoded as an integer
number of centiyears. So the first line divides each element of agepreg by 100, yielding a
floating-point value in years.</p>
<p><code>birthwgt_lb</code> and <code>birthwgt_oz</code> contain
the weight of the baby, in pounds and ounces, for pregnancies that end
in live birth. In addition it uses several special codes:</p>
<pre><code>97 NOT ASCERTAINED
98 REFUSED  
99 DON&#39;T KNOW</code></pre>
<p>Special values encoded as numbers are
<em>dangerous</em> because if they are not handled properly, they can generate
bogus results, like a 99-pound baby. The replace method replaces these
values with np.nan, a special
floating-point value that represents “not a number.” The inplace flag tells replace to modify the existing
Series rather than create a new one.</p>
<p>As part of the IEEE floating-point
standard, all mathematical operations return nan if either argument is <code>nan</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np
&gt;&gt;&gt; np.nan / 100.0
nan</code></pre>
<p>So computations with <code>nan</code> tend to do the right thing, and
most pandas functions handle <code>nan</code> appropriately. But dealing with
missing data will be a recurring issue.</p>
<p>The last line of <code>CleanFemPreg</code> creates a new column
<code>totalwgt_lb</code> that combines pounds and ounces into a single quantity, in
pounds.</p>
<p>One important note: when you add a new
column to a DataFrame, you must use dictionary syntax, like this</p>
<pre><code>    # CORRECT
    df[&#39;totalwgt_lb&#39;] = df.birthwgt_lb + df.birthwgt_oz / 16.0 </code></pre>
<p>Not dot notation, like this:</p>
<pre><code>    # WRONG!
    df.totalwgt_lb = df.birthwgt_lb + df.birthwgt_oz / 16.0 </code></pre>
<p>The version with dot notation adds an
attribute to the DataFrame object, but that attribute is not treated as
a new column.</p>
</div>
<div id="validation" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.7</span> Validation</h2>
<p>When data is exported from one software
environment and imported into another, errors might be introduced. And
when you are getting familiar with a new dataset, you might interpret
data incorrectly or introduce other misunderstandings. If you take time
to validate the data, you can save time later and avoid errors.</p>
<p>One way to validate data is to compute
basic statistics and compare them with published results. For example,
the NSFG codebook includes tables that summarize each variable. Here is
the table for outcome, which
encodes the outcome of each pregnancy:</p>
<pre><code>value label           Total
1 LIVE BIRTH              9148
2 INDUCED ABORTION        1862
3 STILLBIRTH               120
4 MISCARRIAGE             1921
5 ECTOPIC PREGNANCY        190
6 CURRENT PREGNANCY        352</code></pre>
<p>The Series class provides a method,
<code>value_counts</code>, that counts the number of times each value appears. If
we select the outcome Series
from the DataFrame, we can use <code>value_counts</code> to compare with the
published data:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; df.outcome.value_counts(sort=False)
1    9148
2    1862
3     120
4    1921
5     190
6     352</code></pre>
<p>The result of <code>value_counts</code> is a Series;
<code>sort=False</code> doesn’t sort the Series by values, so them appear in
order.</p>
<p>Comparing the results with the published
table, it looks like the values in outcome are correct. Similarly,
here is the published table for <code>birthwgt_lb</code></p>
<pre><code>value label                  Total
. INAPPLICABLE            4449
0-5 UNDER 6 POUNDS          1125
6 6 POUNDS                2223
7 7 POUNDS                3049
8 8 POUNDS                1889
9-95 9 POUNDS OR MORE         799</code></pre>
<p>And here are the value counts:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; df.birthwgt_lb.value_counts(sort=False)
0        8
1       40
2       53
3       98
4      229
5      697
6     2223
7     3049
8     1889
9      623
10     132
11      26
12      10
13       3
14       3
15       1
51       1</code></pre>
<p>The counts for 6, 7, and 8 pounds check
out, and if you add up the counts for 0-5 and 9-95, they check out, too.
But if you look more closely, you will notice one value that has to be
an error, a 51 pound baby!</p>
<p>To deal with this error, I added a line
to <code>CleanFemPreg</code>:</p>
<pre><code>df.loc[df.birthwgt_lb &gt; 20, &#39;birthwgt_lb&#39;] = np.nan</code></pre>
<p>This statement replaces invalid values
with <code>np.nan</code>. The attribute
<code>loc</code> provides several ways to
select rows and columns from a DataFrame. In this example, the first
expression in brackets is the row indexer; the second expression selects
the column.</p>
<p>The expression <code>df.birthwgt_lb &gt; 20</code>
yields a Series of type bool,
where True indicates that the condition is true. When a boolean Series
is used as an index, it selects only the elements that satisfy the
condition.</p>
</div>
<div id="interpretation" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.8</span> Interpretation</h2>
<p>To work with data effectively, you have
to think on two levels at the same time: the level of statistics and the
level of context.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s look at the sequence
of outcomes for a few respondents. Because of the way the data files are
organized, we have to do some processing to collect the pregnancy data
for each respondent. Here’s a function that does that:</p>
<pre><code>def MakePregMap(df):
    d = defaultdict(list)
    for index, caseid in df.caseid.iteritems():
        d[caseid].append(index)
    return d</code></pre>
<p><code>df</code> is the DataFrame with pregnancy
data. The <code>iteritems</code> method
enumerates the index (row number) and caseid for each pregnancy.</p>
<p><code>d</code> is a dictionary that maps from
each case ID to a list of indices. If you are not familiar with <code>defaultdict</code>, it is in the Python
<code>collections</code> module. Using
<code>d</code>, we can look up a
respondent and get the indices of that respondent’s pregnancies.</p>
<p>This example looks up one respondent and
prints a list of outcomes for her pregnancies:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; caseid = 10229
&gt;&gt;&gt; preg_map = nsfg.MakePregMap(df)
&gt;&gt;&gt; indices = preg_map[caseid]
&gt;&gt;&gt; df.outcome[indices].values
[4 4 4 4 4 4 1]</code></pre>
<p>indices is the list of indices for
pregnancies corresponding to respondent 10229.</p>
<p>Using this list as an index into df.outcome selects the indicated
rows and yields a Series. Instead of printing the whole Series, I
selected the values
attribute, which is a NumPy array.</p>
<p>The outcome code 1 indicates a live birth. Code
4 indicates a miscarriage;
that is, a pregnancy that ended spontaneously, usually with no known
medical cause.</p>
<p>Statistically this respondent is not
unusual. Miscarriages are common and there are other respondents who
reported as many or more.</p>
<p>But remembering the context, this data
tells the story of a woman who was pregnant six times, each time ending
in miscarriage. Her seventh and most recent pregnancy ended in a live
birth. If we consider this data with empathy, it is natural to be moved
by the story it tells.</p>
<p>Each record in the NSFG dataset
represents a person who provided honest answers to many personal and
difficult questions. We can use this data to answer statistical
questions about family life, reproduction, and health. At the same time,
we have an obligation to consider the people represented by the data,
and to afford them respect and gratitude.</p>
</div>
<div id="exercises" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.9</span> Exercises</h2>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong></p>
<p>In the repository you downloaded, you should find a file named <code>chap01ex.ipynb</code>, which is an
IPython notebook. You can launch IPython notebook from the command line
like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ ipython notebook &amp;</code></pre>
<p>If IPython is installed, it should launch a server that runs in the background and open a browser to view
the notebook. If you are not familiar with IPython, I suggest you start
at <a href="http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/notebook/notebook.html">http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/notebook/notebook.html</a>.</p>
<p>To launch the IPython notebook server, run:</p>
<pre><code>$ ipython notebook &amp;</code></pre>
<p>It should open a new browser window, but if not, the startup message provides a URL you can load in a browser,
usually <a href="http://localhost:8888">http://localhost:8888</a>. The new window should list the notebooks in
the repository.</p>
<p>Open <code>chap01ex.ipynb</code>. Some cells are already filled in, and you should execute them. Other cells give you
instructions for exercises you should try.</p>
<p><em>A solution to this exercise is in <code>chap01soln.ipynb</code></em></p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong></p>
<p>In the repository you downloaded, you should find a file named <code>chap01ex.py</code>; using this file
as a starting place, write a function that reads the respondent file, <code>2002FemResp.dat.gz</code>.</p>
<p>The variable pregnum is a recode that indicates how many times each respondent has been pregnant. Print the value counts
for this variable and compare them to the published results in the NSFG
codebook.</p>
<p>You can also cross-validate the respondent and pregnancy files by comparing pregnum for each respondent with
the number of records in the pregnancy file.</p>
<p>You can use <code>nsfg.MakePregMap</code> to make a dictionary that maps from each caseid to a list of indices into
the pregnancy DataFrame.</p>
<p><em>A solution to this exercise is in <code>chap01soln.py</code></em></p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong></p>
<p>The best way to learn about statistics is to work on a project you are interested in. Is there
a question like, “Do first babies arrive late,” that you want to investigate?</p>
<p>Think about questions you find personally interesting, or items of conventional wisdom, or
controversial topics, or questions that have political consequences, and
see if you can formulate a question that lends itself to statistical
inquiry.</p>
<p>Look for data to help you address the question. Governments are good sources because data from public research
is often freely available. Good places to start include <a href="http://www.data.gov/">http://www.data.gov/</a>, and <a href="http://www.science.gov/">http://www.science.gov/</a>, and in the United Kingdom, <a href="http://data.gov.uk/">http://data.gov.uk/</a>.</p>
<p>Two of my favorite data sets are the General Social Survey at <a href="http://www3.norc.org/gss+website/">http://www3.norc.org/gss+website/</a>, and the European Social Survey at
<a href="http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/">http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/</a>.</p>
<p>If it seems like someone has already answered your question, look closely to see whether the answer is
justified. There might be flaws in the data or the analysis that make
the conclusion unreliable. In that case you could perform a different
analysis of the same data, or look for a better source of data.</p>
<p>If you find a published paper that addresses your question, you should be able to get the raw data. Many
authors make their data available on the web, but for sensitive data you might have to write to the authors, provide information about how you plan to use the data, or agree to certain terms of use. Be
persistent!</p>
