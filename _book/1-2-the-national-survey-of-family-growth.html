<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> The National Survey of Family Growth</h2>
<p>Since 1973 the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) have conducted the National Survey of
Family Growth (NSFG), which is intended to gather “information on family
life, marriage and divorce, pregnancy, infertility, use of
contraception, and men’s and women’s health. The survey results are used
… to plan health services and health education programs, and to do
statistical studies of families, fertility, and health.” See
<a href="http://cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg.htm">http://cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg.htm</a>.</p>
<p>We will use data collected by this survey
to investigate whether first babies tend to come late, and other
questions. In order to use this data effectively, we have to understand
the design of the study.</p>
<p>The NSFG is a cross-sectional study, which means that
it captures a snapshot of a group at a point in time. The most common
alternative is a longitudinal
study, which observes a group repeatedly over a period of time.</p>
<p>The NSFG has been conducted seven times;
each deployment is called a cycle.
We will use data from Cycle 6, which was conducted from January 2002 to
March 2003.</p>
<p>The goal of the survey is to draw
conclusions about a population;
the target population of the NSFG is people in the United States aged
15-44. Ideally surveys would collect data from every member of the
population, but that’s seldom possible. Instead we collect data from a
subset of the population called a sample. The people who participate in a
survey are called respondents.</p>
<p>In general, cross-sectional studies are
meant to be representative, which
means that every member of the target population has an equal chance of
participating. That ideal is hard to achieve in practice, but people who
conduct surveys come as close as they can.</p>
<p>The NSFG is not representative; instead
it is deliberately oversampled.
The designers of the study recruited three groups—Hispanics,
African-Americans and teenagers—at rates higher than their
representation in the U.S. population, in order to make sure that the
number of respondents in each of these groups is large enough to draw
valid statistical inferences.</p>
<p>Of course, the drawback of oversampling
is that it is not as easy to draw conclusions about the general
population based on statistics from the survey. We will come back to
this point later.</p>
<p>When working with this kind of data, it
is important to be familiar with the codebook, which documents the design of
the study, the survey questions, and the encoding of the responses. The
codebook and user’s guide for the NSFG data are available from
