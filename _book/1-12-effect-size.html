<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.12</span> Effect Size</h2>
<p>An <strong>effect
size</strong> is a summary statistic intended to describe (wait for it)
the size of an effect. For example, to describe the difference between
two groups, one obvious choice is the difference in the means.</p>
<p>Mean pregnancy length for first babies is
38.601; for other babies it is 38.523. The difference is 0.078 weeks,
which works out to 13 hours. As a fraction of the typical pregnancy
length, this difference is about 0.2%.</p>
<p>If we assume this estimate is accurate,
such a difference would have no practical consequences. In fact, without
observing a large number of pregnancies, it is unlikely that anyone
would notice this difference at all.</p>
<p>Another way to convey the size of the
effect is to compare the difference between groups to the variability
within groups. Cohen’s <em>d</em> is a
statistic intended to do that; it is defined</p>

<p>where <span style="text-decoration:overline">x_1</span> and <span style="text-decoration:overline">x_2</span> are the means of the groups
and <em>s</em> is the “pooled standard
deviation”. Here’s the Python code that computes Cohen’s <em>d</em>:</p>
<pre><code>def CohenEffectSize(group1, group2):
    diff = group1.mean() - group2.mean()

    var1 = group1.var()
    var2 = group2.var()
    n1, n2 = len(group1), len(group2)

    pooled_var = (n1 * var1 + n2 * var2) / (n1 + n2)
    d = diff / math.sqrt(pooled_var)
    return d</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the difference in means
is 0.029 standard deviations, which is small. To put that in
perspective, the difference in height between men and women is about 1.7
standard deviations (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size</a>).</p>
<p>## Reporting Results</p>
<p>We have seen several ways to describe the
difference in pregnancy length (if there is one) between first babies
and others. How should we report these results?</p>
<p>The answer depends on who is asking the
question. A scientist might be interested in any (real) effect, no
matter how small. A doctor might only care about effects that are <strong>clinically significant</strong>; that is,
differences that affect treatment decisions. A pregnant woman might be
interested in results that are relevant to her, like the probability of
delivering early or late.</p>
<p>How you report results also depends on
your goals. If you are trying to demonstrate the importance of an
effect, you might choose summary statistics that emphasize differences.
If you are trying to reassure a patient, you might choose statistics
that put the differences in context.</p>
<p>Of course your decisions should also be
guided by professional ethics. It’s ok to be persuasive; you <em>should</em>
design statistical reports and visualizations that tell a story clearly.
But you should also do your best to make your reports honest, and to
acknowledge uncertainty and limitations.</p>
<p>## Exercises</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>  
Based on the results in this chapter, suppose you were asked to summarize what you learned about
whether first babies arrive late.</p>
<p>Which summary statistics would you use
if you wanted to get a story on the evening news? Which ones would you
use if you wanted to reassure an anxious patient?</p>
<p>Finally, imagine that you are Cecil Adams, author of <em>The Straight
Dope</em> (<a href="http://straightdope.com">http://straightdope.com</a>), and your job is to answer the question, “Do
first babies arrive late?” Write a paragraph that uses the results in
this chapter to answer the question clearly, precisely, and honestly.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>  
In the repository you downloaded, you should find a file named <code>chap02ex.ipynb</code>; open it. Some
cells are already filled in, and you should execute them. Other cells
give you instructions for exercises. Follow the instructions and fill in
the answers.</p>
<p><em>A solution to this exercise is in <code>chap02soln.ipynb</code></em></p>
<p>In the repository you downloaded, you
should find a file named <code>chap02ex.py</code>; you can use this file as a
starting place for the following exercises. My solution is in
<code>chap02soln.py</code>.</span></p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>  
The mode of a distribution is the most frequent value; see <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)">http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)</a>. Write a function called <code>Mode</code> that takes a Hist and returns
the most frequent value.</p>
<p>As a more challenging exercise, write a function called <code>AllModes</code> that
returns a list of value-frequency pairs in descending order of
frequency.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4</strong>  
Using the variable <code>totalwgt_lb</code>, investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier
than others. Compute Cohen’s <em>d</em> to quantify the difference between the groups. How does it compare to
the difference in pregnancy length?</p>
